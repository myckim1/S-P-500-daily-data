S&P 500 Daily Data (1927-12-30 to current).

Data Included:

	1. Opening Price
	2. Closing Price
	3. Intraday High & Low Prices
	4. Adjusted Closing Price
	5. % Gain/Loss (Percentage Change between consecutive closing prices)
	6. % Price Fluctuation (High-Low in terms of closing price)
	
PLEASE NOTE: 
All but a few days between 1962-01-01 and 1982-04-10 had an Opening Price = 0.0. For these, I assumed that Opening Price is equal to the Closing Price of the previous trading day.
